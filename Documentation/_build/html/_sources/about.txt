About the API
*************

This API provides a simple way for a developer to create a distributed
program to run on a cluster of low-end hardware such as a cluster of 
Raspberry Pis. Based around `Python Remote Objects (PyRo) <https://pythonhosted.org/Pyro4/>`_, this API
allows a developer to create multiple slave processes distributed across
many nodes with minimal configuration.
